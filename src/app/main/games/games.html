                            addition to the new items in the Overwatch Anniversary event, we’re also adding new goodies to
                            our standard loot boxes. Sombra, Orisa, and Tracer are all getting brand new emotes, and Reaper
                            picks up several new unlocks based on the infamous shrug from the recent Uprising comic. GENERAL
                            Custom Games and Game Browser Added new rules sets for 3v3 and 1v1 Elimination modes on the Arena
                            maps Added options for Hero Lockout, Limited Hero Pool, Tiebreakers, and Hero Reveal for Elimination
                            mode Players can now disable secondary fire and secondary weapons in Custom Games You can now
                            disable one Symmetra ultimate while leaving the other active HERO UPDATES General Recoil Recovery
                            Aim Compensation can now be disabled for Ana, McCree, and Widowmaker. The option can be found
                            under the “Control” tab in the “Options” menu. Simply select the appropriate hero under the dropdown
                            menu and look for the “Hero” section Developer Comments: By default, weapon recoil recovery is
                            overruled by downward crosshair movement. This means that downward movement during the weapon’s
                            recoil recovery phase will override the weapon’s natural recoil recovery. This option allows
                            you to remove this functionality, meaning a weapon’s natural recoil recovery movement acts independently
                            from downward crosshair movement. In practice, this will make your crosshair move faster if you
                            aim downward during the recoil recovery window. Genji Removed the attack delay from Genji’s wall
                            climbing ability, allowing him to engage with enemies immediately after he finishes climbing
                            Developer Comments: This is a quality of life change to make wall climbing feel better. Hanzo
                            Removed the attack cooldown from Hanzo’s wall climbing ability, allowing him to engage with enemies
                            immediately after he finishes climbing Storm Bow Increased charge speed by 10% Charged arrows
                            now maintain their charge after climbing a wall, provided the button is continuously held Developer
                            Comments: Decreasing Hanzo’s draw time gives him more overall DPS, while also letting him fully
                            charge an arrow and more quickly return to full movement speed when needed. And, like the change
                            to Genji’s wall climbing, this is a quality of life change that will make climbing feel better.
                            Orisa Fusion Driver Damage reduced by 9% Protective Barrier Cooldown reduced from 12 seconds
                            to 8 seconds Developer Comments: To help Orisa maintain the front line for her team, we’re reducing
                            the cooldown of her Protective Barrier. This change also helps her reposition the barrier more
                            easily when needed. To compensate for this new defensive strength, we're reducing her Fusion
                            Driver's damage, as it felt too high. Reaper Wraith Form Ammo is now entirely refilled when Wraith
                            Form is used Developer Comments: Wraith Form is typically used as an escape ability after firing.
                            This change gives Reaper a fighting chance if an enemy chases him down as he uses it. Reinhardt
                            Earthshatter Effective height has been lowered from 3 meters to 2 meters The height threshold
                            of objects that Earthshatter can "climb" has been lowered from 3 meters to 2 meters, making Earthshatter
                            less likely to climb tall objects as it moves along the ground. Developer Comments: Earthshatter
                            tended to climb unexpectedly high, frequently hitting targets that were significantly above the
                            ground. These changes help the ability stay more grounded. Soldier: 76 Heavy Pulse Rifle Bullet
                            damage decreased from 20 to 19 Developer Comments: Soldier: 76 is in a much better place lately,
                            but his damage output was making him a must pick, compared to similar roles. USER INTERFACE UPDATES
                            Your final blows are now highlighted by a white background in the Kill Feed Added new Kill Feed
                            icons for environmental kills and a number of abilities Heroes resurrected by Mercy are now are
                            now highlighted and color-coded in the Kill Feed Certain types of assists, like McCree’s Flashbang
                            or Zenyatta’s Orb of Discord, now show up in the Kill Feed New Controller option: Force Keyboard/Mouse
                            User Interface Developer Comments: When PC players switch from using the Keyboard/Mouse to a
                            game controller, the game’s user interface is dynamically updated to the console/controller version.
                            Additionally, the button layout on many heroes (like Hanzo, Zenyatta, and Mercy) is different
                            on console. In the past, when a player chose to play using a controller and a mouse, the UI would
                            constantly switch, depending on which device was sending information to the game. This new option
                            allows players to set a default user interface if they choose to use a controller along with
                            a keyboard/mouse. BUG FIXES General Fixed an issue that prevented voice lines from being heard
